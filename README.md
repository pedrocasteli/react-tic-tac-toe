# Tic-Tac-Toe with React.js

This project was created to help me improve my skills with the **React.js** library. Originally, this application was built by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller** on the [React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)] course on [Udemy].

## Install and Run

Install the dependencies and devDependencies:

```sh
cd react-tic-tac-toe
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This project requires [Node.js] to run. My version at the time was **20.15.0**.
